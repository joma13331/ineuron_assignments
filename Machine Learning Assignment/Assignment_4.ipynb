    "    Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers. Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data. This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",

    "2. Categorical Data:\n",
    "    Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown. Categorical data can take numerical values. For example, maybe we would use 1 for the colour red and 2 for blue. But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take the average.\n",

    "3. Time Series Data:\n",
    "    Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time. It is very important, especially in particular fields like finance. Time series data has a temporal value attached to it, so this would be something like a date or a timestamp that you can look for trends in time.\n",

    "5. Images\n",
    "    Image data is represented usually in RGB values for coloured images i.e. consisting of 3 channels with values in range (0, 255). We perform processing and evaluation of these values to train and teach ML/DL Algorithms to predict on Images "
