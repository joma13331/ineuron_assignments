    "      1.  Binning Method: This method works on sorted data in order to smooth it. The whole data is divided into segments of equal size and then various methods are performed to complete the task. Each segmented is handled separately. One can replace all data in a segment by its mean or boundary values can be used to complete the task.\n",

The two effective methods of dimensionality reduction are:Wavelet transforms and PCA (Principal Component Analysis).\n",
