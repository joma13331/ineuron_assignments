    "**Q1. Raindrops are falling at an average rate of 20 drops per square inch per minute. What would be a reasonable distribution to use for the number of raindrops hitting a particular region measuring 5 inches2 in t minutes? Why? Using your chosen distribution, compute the probability that the region has no rain drops in a given 3 second time interval. A reasonable choice of distribution is P.**\n",

    "In our question an average rate of an event happening per unit per time is given and we asked to determine the probability of another event in another duration of time. **In such cases Poisson Distribution will be a suitable distribution**.\n",
