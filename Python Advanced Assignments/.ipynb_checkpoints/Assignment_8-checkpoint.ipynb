    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In 3.X, exceptions must be defined by classes (that is, a class instance object is raised and caught). \n",
    "* In addition, exception classes must be derived from the builtin class BaseException; most programs inherit from its Exception subclass, to support catchall handlers for normal kinds of exceptions."

    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Class-based exceptions match by superclass relationships: naming a superclass in an exception handler will catch instances of that class, as well as instances of any of its subclasses lower in the class tree. \n",
    "* Because of this, you can think of superclasses as general exception categories and subclasses as more specific types of exceptions within those categories."

    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can attach context information to class-based exceptions by filling out instance attributes in the instance object raised, usually in a custom class constructor. \n",
    "* For simpler needs, built-in exception superclasses provide a constructor that stores its arguments on the instance automatically (as a tuple in the attribute args). \n",
    "* In exception handlers, you list a variable to be assigned to the raised instance, then go through this name to access attached state information and call any methods defined in the class."

    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The error message text in class-based exceptions can be specified with a custom \\__str__ operator overloading method. \n",
    "* For simpler needs, built-in exception superclasses automatically display anything you pass to the class constructor. \n",
    "    * Operations like print and str automatically fetch the display string of an exception object when it is printed either explicitly or as part of an error message."

    "**Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* String-based exceptions did not support categories, state information, or behavior inheritance in the way class-based exceptions do. \n",
    "* In practice, this made string-based exceptions easier to use at first when programs were small, but more complex to use as programs grew larger."
