    "**Q1. What is the meaning of multiple inheritance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multiple inheritance occurs when a class inherits from more than one superclass.\n",
    "* It’s useful for mixing together multiple packages of class-based code. The left-toright order in class statement headers determines the general order of attribute searches."

    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Delegation involves wrapping an object in a proxy class, which adds extra behavior and passes other operations to the wrapped object. \n",
    "* The proxy retains the interface of the wrapped object."

    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Composition is a technique whereby a controller class embeds and directs a number of objects, and provides an interface all its own.\n",
    "* It’s a way to build up larger structures with classes."

    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bound methods combine an instance and a method function. \n",
    "* you can call them without passing in an instance object explicitly because the original instance is still available."

    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pseudoprivate attributes (whose names begin but do not end with two leading underscores: \\__X) are used to localize names to the enclosing class. \n",
    "* This includes both class attributes like methods defined inside the class, and self instance attributes assigned inside the class’s methods.\n",
    "* Such names are expanded to include the class name on the right side, which makes them generally unique."
