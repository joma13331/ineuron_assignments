    "\n",
    "* It implements real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "* The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "* Python was designed with OOP approach and it offers the following advantages:\n",
    "    * Provides a clear program structure and a clean code\n",
    "    * Facilitates easy maintenance and modification of existing code\n",
    "    * Since the class is sharable, the code can be reused\n",

    "\n",
    "SOLUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every time you use an expression of the form ```object.attr``` where object is an instance or class object, Python searches the namespace tree at and above object, for the first attr it can find. \n",
    "* Lower definitions in the tree override higher ones, inheritance forms the basis of specialization.\n",
